	POLISH NOTATION:-
	The method of writing operators of an expression either before their oprands or after them is called the polish notation. 
	
	WAY OF WRITING:-
	1 Infix Notation
	2 Prefix Notation
	3 Postfix Notation
	
	INFIX_NOTATION=
	When the operators exist between two operands then the expression is called Infix Notation
	Example: a+b

	PREFIX_NOTATION=
	When the operators are written before their operands then the expression is called the Prefix Notation
	Example: +ab

	POSTFIX_NOTATION=
	When the operators are written after their operands then the expression is called the Postfix Notation
	Example: ab+
	
	Now i will solve this example*/
	
//  A+[(B+C)+(D+E)*F]/G    ...Convert to postfix notation you can also convert many notation variations   
//	A+[(BC+)+(DE+)*F]/G
//	A+(BC+(DE+*F)/G
//	A+BC+DE+F*+ G/
//  ABC+DE+F*+G/+  this is a final answer

	return 0;
