BINARY_TREE
A binary tree T is defined as a finite set of elements,called nodes,such that
1=Tree is empty(called the null tree or empty tree)
2=Tree contains a distinguished node R,called the root of T,and the remaining nodes of Tree form an ordered pair of disjoint binary trees T1 and T2.


The root of T is the node A at the top of the diagram
A left downward slanted line from a node N indicates Left Successor of N,and a right download slanted line N indicates a right successor of N.

A Definiation of binary tree is recursive since T is defined in terms of the binary subtrees T1 abd T2,This means,In particular ,That every Node N of T contains a left and right subtree.
