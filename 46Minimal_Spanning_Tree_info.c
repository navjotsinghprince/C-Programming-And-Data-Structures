Minimal Spanning Tree

We Then wish to find an acyclic subset T that connects all of the vertices and whose total weight is minimized

Since T is acyclic and connects all of the vertices,it must form a tree,which we call a spaning tree since it spans the graph G...

We call the problem of determining the tree T the minimum spanning tree problem
