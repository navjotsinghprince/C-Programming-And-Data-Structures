#DATA_TYPE
1=A Data Type In A Programming Language Is A Set Of Data With The Values Having Predefined Characteristics.

2=System/Compiler Defined Data Type Called Primitive Data Type.

3=Structures In C/C++ And Classes In C++/Java Are Means To Create Our Own Data Type Known As User Defined Data Type.

#DATA_STRUCTURE:-
Data Structure Is A Particular Way Of Storing And Organizing Data In A Computer So That It Can Be Used Efficiently.

#TWO MAJOR CLASSIFICATION OF DATA STRUCTURES ARE:-
 -Linear Data Structures (Link List,Stack Queue)
 -Non Linear Data Structures (Tree,Graph)
_______________________________________________________________
 ABSTRACT DATA TYPE:-
#All Primitive Data Types Supports Basic Operations Like Addition Subtraction Etc.

#The System Is Providing The Implemention For The Primitive Data Types
For Non Primitive Data Types We Also Need To Define Operations.

#Combinations Of Data Structures And Their Operations Are Known As Abstract Data Type(ADT).

#So The Data Structures Is All About Creating Abstract Data Type
Any Piece Of Information Can Be Handled By Defining Appropriate Data Type And Set Of Possible Operations............
