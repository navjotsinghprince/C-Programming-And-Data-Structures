RECURSION=Any function which calls itself is called recursive.

A Recursive method solves a problem by calling a copy to itself to work on a smaller problem.

It is important to ensure that the recursion terminates.

Each time the function call itself with a slightly simpler version of the original problem.

yarr Recursive code is generally shorter and easier to write than iterative code.

It terminates when base is reached.

Each Recursive call requires extra space on the stack frame like memory

BACKTRACKING
 Backtracking is the method of exhausted search using divide and conquer
 Sometimes the best algorithm for a problem is to try all possibillites.
 this is always slow
