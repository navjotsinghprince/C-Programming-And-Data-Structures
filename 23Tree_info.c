A Tree is a Hierachical Data Structure.
A Tree is defined as a finite set of one or more data items(nodes) such that

1. There is a special node called the root of the tree.
2. The Remaining nodes are partitioned into n>0 disjoints subsets,each of which is itself a tree,and They are called sub-trees */

/*TERMINOLOGIES
DEGREE=The number of sub-Trees of a node is called its Degree.child nodes ki counting ko degree bolegy.

LEAF=A node with degree zero is called Leaf. jiska koi child na ho wo leaf node hota hai.

Terminal Nodes: The Leaf nodes are also called terminal Nodes.

DEGREE OF TREE=The Degree Of the Tree is maximum degree of the nodes in the tree.jiske sabse jyda child nodes hongy.

ANACESTORS=The Anacestors of a node are all the nodes along the path from the root to that node...kisi node ke oper wale nodes anacestors(purwanj) hongy.

DESCENDANTS=The descendants of a node are all the nodes along the path from node to terminal node...kisi node ke niche wale nodes descendants(vansanj) hongy.

LEVEL_NUMBER=Each node is assigned a level number..the root node of tree is assigned a level number which is 1 more than the level number of its parent..start from 0..

GENERATION=Nodes with the same level number are said to belong to the same Generation..level number jo 0 se start hota hai supppose 0 to 3 hai toh ma khuga 4 generations hai..

HEIGHT/DEPTH=The height or Depth of a tree is the maximum number of nodes in a branch...

EDGE=A line drawn from a node N of T to a Successor Is Called an edge.connecting lines

PATH=Sequence of consecutive edges is called path..

BRANCH=Path ending in a leaf is called a Branch..
